Logan Andersen:
    I learned a lot during this iteration. I was fairly new to Django
    and so software engineering so I got some experience when it came
    to both of those. I did a lot of new things like: drawing wireframe
    diagrams, playing planning poker, writing things in Connextra,
    HTML templates, github kanban, and many other things. One thing that
    didn't go well was our initial github integration, at the beginning
    our github projects were pre-made but misformatted, and people began
    adding their issues into our list, this was solved by creating our
    own github projects instead of using the ones given to us by the
    school. I would say that doing planning poker was very usefull for
    me since it let us find out that some of our Connextra stories were
    vague, and needed further work.
